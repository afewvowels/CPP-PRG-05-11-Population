//  Write a program that will predict the size of a population of organisms. The program
//  should ask the user for the starting number of organisms, their average daily population
//  increase (as a percentage), and the number of days they will multiply. A loop
//  should display the size of the population for each day.
//
//  Input Validation: Do not accept a number less than 2 for the starting size of the population.
//  Do not accept a negative number for average daily population increase. Do not
//  accept a number less than 1 for the days they will multiply.
